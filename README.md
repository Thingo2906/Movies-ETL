# Movies-ETL
## Purpose: 
- The purpose of this study is to develop an automated data extraction, transformation, and loading process. This study is divided into four sections, with each step progressing from the commencement of data extraction and function testing, through the transformation and cleaning process, to the last step of connecting and loading the data into the database. In the last phase of the ETL process, ETL create database.ipynb, a single call to the function extract transform load can complete the whole ETL process.
- The EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, and LOAD procedures were introduced in this project. For a fictitious hackathon, movie data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and aggregated reviews were utilized to create a movie database from a clean dataset.
